# Train Fare Calculator
I made a simple Python-based project developed as part of the VITYARTHI PROJECT requirements.  
The program calculates the total train fare based on distance, coach type, discount category,  
and GST.

# Project Overview
This application allows the user to enter the distance in kilometers and select the coach type.  
The system calculates the base fare, applies discount (if any), adds 5% GST, and finally displays  
the total fare.

# Features
- Input distance and coach choice  
- Base fare calculation using fixed rate per km  
- Discount module:
  - Student (10%)
  - Senior Citizen (20%)
  - Military (15%)
  - No Discount
- GST module (5% GST)
- Final amount calculation and display
- There are 5 major functioning module

# Modules Used
1. get_details() – User input  
2. basic_fare() – Base fare computation  
3. apply_offer() – Discount calculation  
4. add_tax() – GST addition  
5. show_total() – Display output  

## How to Run
Firstly you have to download the Python  
And then run the program using: python3 fare calculator.py

# Testing
- Functionality tested with different distances  
- All coach types are tested  
- All discount options are tested  
- GST calculation are manually verified
